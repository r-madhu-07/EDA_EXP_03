**EXP 3 - Delhi Air Quality Analysis**

**Aim**


To compare air quality parameters in Delhi across different stations and analyze the relationship between pollutants (e.g., PM2.5 and NO₂) using scatter plots and correlation analysis.


**Procedure / Algorithm**

1)Load the dataset using pandas.

2)Preprocess the data:

3)Convert the date column (period.datetimeFrom.utc) to datetime format.

4)Drop missing or invalid values.

5)Pivot the dataset so each pollutant (parameter) becomes a separate column.

6)Plot scatter plot between PM2.5 and NO₂ to study their relationship.

7)Plot correlation heatmap between all pollutants to identify relationships.

8)Interpret the results — identify which pollutants are correlated and which stations are most polluted.

**Output**

**Interpretation**

1)PM2.5 and NO₂ show a strong positive correlation, suggesting that both pollutants increase together, likely due to vehicle and industrial emissions.

2)  # write other insights

**Result**

The dataset was successfully loaded and processed to extract pollutant-wise and station-wise air quality data for Delhi.
